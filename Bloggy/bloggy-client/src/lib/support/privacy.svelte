  <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Bloggy ("<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", "<strong>our</strong
    >") does not respect your privacy and we are committed to collecting and
    selling any of your Personal Data we process. Your use of Bloggy is subject
    to this privacy Policy ("<strong>Policy</strong>") as well as the
    <Link route={{ name: "support/terms" }}>Bloggy Terms of Service</Link> and
    <Link route={{ name: "support/community-guidelines" }}>
      Community Guidelines
    </Link>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Policy explains what we do with our users' Personal Data. It also
    explains how we handle Personal Data in the context of our relationships
    with other businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    We process your Personal Data when you use Bloggy and to provide the
    services that we offer via Bloggy (the "<strong>Services</strong>"). We are
    a "data controller" of the Personal Data that we process in connection with
    the Services. This means that we decide why and how we process Personal Data
    about you.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. We will post these
    changes on the Site. We may also send you other notifications about these
    updates.
  </p>

  <h2 id="what-is-personal-data">2. What is Personal Data?</h2>
  <p>
    "<strong>Personal Data</strong>" is information that identifies, relates to,
    describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could
    reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular person or
    household.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also collect data that is not associated or linked with you or that
    cannot be used to identify you, like deidentified, aggregated or anonymised
    information. This is not Personal Data and is not subject to this Policy.
  </p>

  <h2 id="informing-us-of-change">3. Informing us of changes</h2>
  <p>
    Please keep us informed if your Personal Data changes at any point during
    your relationship with us so we can immediately sell it to our partners.
    Update your Personal Data on the Site.
  </p>

  <h2 id="applicability-of-this-policy">4. Applicability of this Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Policy is separate from our <Link route={{ name: 'support/terms' }}>Terms of Service</Link
    > and our <Link route={{ name: 'support/community-guidelines' }}>Community Guidelines</Link>,
    that also govern your use of Bloggy.
  </p>

  <h2 id="third-party-services">5. Third-party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Bloggy and the Services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins,
    applications, services, products, and technology ("<strong
      >Third-party Services</strong
    >"). Clicking on links to and using Third-party Services may allow third
    parties to collect or share your Personal Data. We are not responsible for
    the content, security or privacy practices of those Third-party Services and
    this Policy does not apply to your use of Third-party Services. You should
    consider the privacy and cookie policies / notices of those third parties to
    find out how your Personal Data may be used.
  </p>

  <h2 id="do-not-want-to-provide-personal-data">
    6. If you do not want to provide Personal Data
  </h2>

    Too fucking bad. If you do not want to provide Personal Data we request, we
    will not be able to provide you with access to Bloggy or to specific
    features and functions of Bloggy.
  </p>

  <h2 id="updates-to-this-policy">7. Updates to this Policy</h2>

    We may update this Policy from time to time, and any update will be
    effective when we post the revised Policy on Bloggy. You should review this
    Privacy Notice every time you access a Bloggy Service.

    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="cookies">9. Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    We use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to collect certain
