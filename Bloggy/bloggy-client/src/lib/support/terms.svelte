      <strong>Important Note:</strong> These Terms contain an agreement to resolve

    us recognize hashes of known illegal content and that can detect violations
    of our terms based on the text in and content of a post. We also rely on
    user reports, trusted flaggers, law enforcement reports, and reports we
    receive from NGOs and civil society. When notified, we act swiftly to
    minimize exposure.

      the Exception to Exclusion below,
      <strong>Bloggy and its affiliates will not be liable for:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages—such
          as lost profits, business interruption, or loss of data;

        <li>Costs for substitute services;</li>
        <li>
          Any third-party claims, including those arising from User Content.

      <strong
        >All third-party claims are expressly excluded from Bloggy's liability</strong
      >, regardless of cause or theory of liabiltiy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Exceptions to Exclusion.</u>
      The exclusions in this Section do not apply to claims of death or personal
      injury based on:
      <ol>
        <li>Bloggy's fraud or criminal misconduct;</li>
        <li>Gross negligence or willfull misconduct by Bloggy;</li>
        <li>

    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="governing-law-dispute-resolution">
    12. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, Venue, Dispute Resolution, and Arbitration
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <u>Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</u>
      These Terms and any disputes or claims arising out of or relating to them (including
      non-contractual disputes) are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable
      federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Kentucky, without regard
      to its conflict of law principles.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Jurisdiction and Venue.</u>
      Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, any legal action that is not subject
      to arbitration must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located
      in Kentucky. You and Bloggy consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those
      courts and waive any objections based on forum or convenience.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Mandatory Local Law Exception.</u>
      If you reside in a jurisdiction that requires the application of its own local
      laws, courts, or other mandatory procedures for non-arbitral disputes—such
      as Brazil—then those mandatory provisions will apply instead of the Kentucky
      governing law and venue provisions in this Section, but only to the extent
      required by applicable law.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</u>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Informal Resolution.</strong>
          Most disputes can be resolved informally. If you have an issue with the
          services, you agree to contact us first and allow us at least 60 days to
          resolve the dispute before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. In order
          for your informal resolution request to be valid and for us to respond,
          you must provide us with: your name, your email address, a statement that
          you are invoking the pre-arbitration informal dispute resolution process,
          the jurisdiction where you live (city and state, province, or county),
          your account handle, the specific amount of damages and/or other relief
          you are seeking, all supporting evidence in your possession that will help
          us resolve the dispute, links to or descriptions of the location of any
          evidence you know of but do not possess that will help us resolve the dispute,
          and whether you intend to pursue arbitration if we cannot resolve your
          dispute informally and, if so, what your claim will be in arbitration.
          <br />
          You agree that after you submit your informal resolution request, you will
          participate with us via telephone or video conference, in a good-faith
          effort to resolve the dispute informally. If you are represented by counsel,
          your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to
          fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented
          by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference, but we will
          have a company representative fully participate in the conference.
          <br />
          The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled
          while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required
          by this paragraph. You agree that participating in the informal dispute
          resolution process described in this paragraph is a necessary pre-condition
          to filing an arbitration demand.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mantadory, Mutual Arbitration of Disputes.</strong>
          If the Informal Resolution process listed above does not resolve your dispute,
          you agree that, subject only to the below carve-out and to the maximum
          extent permitted by local laws, you will resolve any dispute, disagreement,
          or claim relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration
          by AAA (U.S.) or ICDR (UK/EU), seated in the county (or parish) where you
          live, unless we agree to a different location. Both parties agree that
          the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating
          to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this
          arbitration agreement. Each party shall select one arbitrator; the pair
          appoint a third.
          <br />
          Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed
          by the AAA Rules. If we prevail in arbitration we'll pay all of our attorneys'
          fees and costs and won't seek to recover them from you, unless the arbitrator
          determines your claims were frivolous. If you prevail in arbitration you
          will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent
          provided under applicable law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Carve-Out for Safety Claims.</strong>
          Arbitration does not apply to claims that fraud, criminal misconduct, or
          gross negligence by Bloggy caused death or personal injury. Those matters
          may be brought in court or arbitration, at the claimant's choice, subject
          to these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Waiver of Class Actions.</strong>
          TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND BLOGGY AGREE THAT EACH
          MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY,
          AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLASS MEMBER, OR REPRESENTATIVE IN ANY PURPORTED
          CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
          <br />
          If any part of this Waiver of Representative Actions is found to be unenforceable,
          Section 13.D ("Dispute Resolution and Arbitration") shall be deemed void
          in its entirety.
          <br />
          Nothing in this section shall prohibit the AAA's consolidation of the administration
          of multiple claims pursuant to the AAA Rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bloggy's Discretion to Consolidate.</strong>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, Bloggy may, at its sole discretion,
          elect to consolidate multiple arbitrations involving similar issues or
          claimants into a single consolidated arbitration or class-arbitration-like
          proceeding. Any such consolidation will occur only under the applicable
          AAA rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Small Claims and Injunctive Relief.</strong>
          This clause, "Dispute Resolution and Arbitration," does not restrict you
          from bringing eligible claims in small claims court. It also does not waive
          your statutory rights under the law of your country of residence.
          <br />
          To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim in arbitration and seek
          public injunctive relief (injunctive relief that has the primary purpose
          and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to
          the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated
          in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, not in arbitration. The parties
          agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be
          stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
        </li>

    <em>
      Summary: These rules are the whole agreement between you and Bloggy. If
      one part doesn't hold up in court, the rest still counts. We'll contact
      you through the app, website, or email. If we don't enforce a rule right
      away, we can still enforce it later. We try to keep things fair, and short
      summaries in italics, like this one, are just to help you understand—they
      don't change the rules.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <u>Entire Agreement.</u>
      These Terms, together with the Bloggy
      <Link route={{ name: 'support/community-guidelines' }}>Community Guidelines</Link>, and
      <Link route={{ name: 'support/privacy' }}>Privacy Policy</Link>, constitute the complete and
      exclusive agreement between you and Bloggy regarding your use of Bloggy.
      They supersede and replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements,
      understandings, or communications—whether oral or written—between you and
      Bloggy concerning the same subject matter.
      <br />
      If any provision of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable
      by an arbitrator or court, it will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted
      by law, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Severability.</u>
      If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable,
      that provision will be severed from these Terms, and the remainder will continue
      in full force and effect.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Notices.</u>
      We may provide notices to you by posting them on our website, or by sending
      them by email or other communication methods based on the information associated
      with your account. By using Bloggy, you agree to receive communications from
      us electronically and acknowledge that all electronic communications satisfy
      any legal requirement for a written communication.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Waiver.</u>
      Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms is not a waiver of our
      rights to enforce it later. To be effective, any waiver must be in writing
      and signed by an authorized Bloggy representative. The exercise of one right
      does not waive other rights or remedies unless explicitly stated.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Interpretation.</u>
      These Terms shall be interpreted fairly and without bias to either party. As
      used in these Terms, the terms "including," "includes," "such as," and "for
      example" mean "without limitation."
      <br />
      The italicized summaries at the beginning of some sections are provided for
      convenience and ease of navigation only. They do not have any legal effect.
      In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between a summary and the full
      text of the Terms, the full text will govern.
